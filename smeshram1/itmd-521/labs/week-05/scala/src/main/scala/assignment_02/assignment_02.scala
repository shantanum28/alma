    // OUTPUT :- Observation - The table displays observations from various devices along with the battery life, CO2 concentration, and individual device names for each. With information about each device's operational data, each row represents a unique device. As an example, the device named "device-mac-111327FkK365" in the first row has a CO2 level of 800 and a battery level of 4. In the same way, the rows that follow list other devices' specifics and condense their unique features.

Every row represents a separate nation, displaying that nation's name (shortened to "cn") together with the commensurate average CO2 concentration. The first row, for example, shows the average CO2 level of 1593.5 for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, whereas the second row shows the average CO2 level of 1588.0 for the Solomon Islands. Comparably, the average CO2 levels of the Federated States of Micronesia, Rwanda, and the British Indian Ocean Territory are provided, offering insights on environmental measurements around the globe.

It contains humidity, CO2 levels, battery levels, and minimum and maximum temperatures. For instance, the lowest recorded temperature is 10°C, while the highest is 34°C. There is a range of battery levels (0 to 9) and CO2 levels (800 to 1599 parts per million) available. Furthermore, there is a range in humidity from 25% to 99%. These measures shed light on the variety of environmental circumstances that the dataset records.

    // OUTPUT: Observation :- Here i have shown top 5 rows . The table displays averaged information for several nations, such as average temperature, average CO2 concentration, average humidity, and country codes (cca2) and names (cn). Every row showcases a different country with its own set of measurements. Anguilla (AI), for instance, has an average temperature of roughly 31.14°C, an average CO2 level of roughly 1165.14 ppm, and an average humidity of roughly 50.71%, according to the top row. In a similar manner, the average environmental measurements for Greenland (GL), Gabon (GA), Vanuatu (VU), and Saint Lucia (LC) are listed, providing information on the climate in various areas.
